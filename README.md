Amidst a wealth of medical data and the burgeoning realm of Data Science, a multitude of startups have embarked on the challenge of devising indicators for impending diseases. Leading the charge are cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), reigning as the primary global cause of mortality. These ailments claim an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, constituting 31% of all worldwide deaths. Among these, heart failure emerges as a prevalent consequence of CVDs.

Individuals afflicted by cardiovascular ailments or those perched on the precipice of high cardiovascular risk—courtesy of factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing conditions—require early identification and adept management. Herein lies the potential of a machine learning model to extend its aiding hand. This technological synergy seeks to not only automate a natural conundrum but also direct our gaze toward upcoming challenges, all bolstered by the prowess of AI techniques.
